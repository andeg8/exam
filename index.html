    <h3>What Are Solar Flares?</h3>
    <h4>Definition: A brief eruption of intense high-energy radiation from the sun's surface,<br>associated with sunspots and causing electromagnetic disturbances on the earth,<br>as with radio frequency communications and power line transmissions.</h4>

      <h3>How are Solar Flares formed?</h3>
      <h4>A solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released.</h4>

    <h3>What is a CME?</h3>
    <h4>A CME or Coronal Mass Ejection follows a solar flare and is when a piece of the sun breaks off and explodes.</h4>
    <div class="right1">
      <h3>What could a CME do?</h3>
      <h4>The effects of a massive CME could destroy the Earth's atmosphere. It was recently discovered that if a planet loses it's magnetic field it's atmosphere will dissipate. This is what is believed by some to have happened to mars after a solar flare and CME hit it.</h4>

    <h3>Solar Storm of 2012</h3>
    <h4>The solar storm of 2012 was the biggest recorded CME ever. It was extremely close to hitting earth, although it didn’t.<br> A study says 
“...the recovery time from such a disaster would have been about four to ten years.”</h4>
